<h2>Blockchain Utilities and Test Application</h2>
The BlockchainUtils library contains functionality to create and append a basic hash linked blockchain, proof-of-work blockchain, or transaction-based blockchain with configuration options for the hash algorithm and mining difficulty and a simple validator to check the integrity of the blockchain.
<br/><br/>
A test application is included to perform a selection of different tests on the different types of blockchain to provide an example of operation. This includes a test for blockchain creation and synchronization over a simple P2P network, with separate the P2P network functionality placed within a separate project that can be easily modified to use independently of the blockchain scope.
